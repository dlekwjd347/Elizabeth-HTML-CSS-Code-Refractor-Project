# Elizabeth-HTML-CSS-Code-Refractor-Project

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


title given a descriptive name "Horiseon Home Page"
link for Search Engine Optimization on top links properly to section on the page by linking id="search-engine-optimization"
added a description for each image for accessibility (6 images)
minimize div by including sections instead
separated header, body section, and footer by replacing corresponding div for proper semantic order
reordered the css styling for corresponding header, body, and footer in style.css to follow W3 compliance
consolidated elements with identical styling 
added proper puncuation for ones missing in fonts.
